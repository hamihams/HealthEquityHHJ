    <h3> We are dedicated to improving the overall health of the community and elevating the voices and low-income and disadvantaged groups of color. </h3>

    <h5>The Bay Area is known for our mass diversity in culture and backgrounds, yet many communities experience discrimination and barriers in their rights to healthcare. We wish to transfrom healthcare so that low income and minoriy groups can have better access to and knowledge about their rights and health to better care for themselves and break down systemic health inequalities.</h5>
